    <name>Track 2 Columns (deprecated)</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
       Extracts data from a chosen track (or summary annotation) for further analysis as columns

        <intro>
        Extracts data from a track of your choice (or comment) from a sequence as columns. This
        node permits non-track aware sequence nodes to process data.
        
        <p><b>THIS NODE IS NO LONGER USED:</b> it has been replaced by the more capable String2Columns node instead.</p>
        </intro>
       
        <option name="Column to process">Select the column of sequences with at least two annotated tracks
        (with regions) for comparison. For example, sequences annotated with TMHMM (transmembrane helix prediction)and 
        StringFinder nodes (eg. identified peptides)can be used here. Tracks can come from many other nodes too
        (eg. BLAST or InterPro)</option>
