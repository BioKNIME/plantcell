#summary Introduce the PlantCell bioinformatics extension to KNIME

= Introduction =

This project contains a series of nodes ('programs' if you will) for
the KNIME (knime.org) platform to make it easier for users to perform basic bioinformatics tasks, even for large datasets eg. RNA-seq.

These nodes provide partial integration of:
 * EMBOSS (emboss.sourceforge.net)
 * JavaProtLib
 * BioJava
 * JUNG
 * GenePattern
 * NCBI BLAST+
 * ESTScan, SignalP, TargetP, GolgiP + numerous other prediction programs
 * and many other toolkits
