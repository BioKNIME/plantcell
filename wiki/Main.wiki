#summary Introduce the PlantCell bioinformatics extension to KNIME

= Introduction =

This project contains a series of nodes ('programs' if you will) for
the KNIME (knime.org) platform to make it easier for users to perform basic bioinformatics tasks, even for large datasets eg. RNA-seq.

These nodes provide partial integration of:
 * EMBOSS (emboss.sourceforge.net)
 * JavaProtLib
 * BioJava
 * JUNG
 * GenePattern
 * NCBI BLAST+
 * ESTScan, SignalP, TargetP, GolgiP + numerous other prediction programs
 * and many other toolkits

3) press Enter
4) Select 'PlantCell KNIME nodes'
5) click 'Next' and follow the prompts. The software is not currently
signed, so you'll need to trust it.

== Source ==

 * install KNIME SDK (see www.knime.org for details)
 * start eclipse
 * download the knime-plantcell source tree from google code
 * file -> import the tree into eclipse
 * build it
 * use "PlantCell update site" to create the necessary files for an eclipse update site (strongly recommended)
 * copy these files to a website somewhere
 * start KNIME and check help->install new software 
 * enter the website root URL eg. http://my.web.site/plantcell
 * click on 'Cell Biology -> PlantCell' and follow the prompts
 * done! PHEW!
