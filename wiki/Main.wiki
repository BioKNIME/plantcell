#summary Introduce the PlantCell bioinformatics extension to KNIME

= Introduction =

This project contains a series of nodes ('programs' if you will) for
the KNIME (knime.org) platform to make it easier for users to perform basic bioinformatics tasks, even for large datasets eg. RNA-seq.

These nodes provide partial integration of:
 * EMBOSS (emboss.sourceforge.net)
 * JavaProtLib
 * BioJava
 * JUNG
 * GenePattern
 * NCBI BLAST+
 * ESTScan, SignalP, TargetP, GolgiP + numerous other prediction programs
 * and many other toolkits

= Installation =

== Binary ==

Not yet available (coming soon).

== Source ==

 * install KNIME SDK (see www.knime.org for details)
 * start eclipse
 * download the knime-plantcell source tree from google code
 * file -> import the tree into eclipse
 * build it
 * use "PlantCell update site" to create the necessary files for an eclipse update site (strongly recommended)
 * copy these files to a website somewhere
 * start KNIME and check help->install new software 
 * enter the website root URL eg. http://my.web.site/plantcell
 * click on 'Cell Biology -> PlantCell' and follow the prompts
 * done! PHEW!
