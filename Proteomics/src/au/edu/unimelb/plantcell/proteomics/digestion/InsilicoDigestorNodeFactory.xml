    <shortDescription>
        Performs in-silico digestion of a protein sequence, optionally filtering for molecular
        weights of interest.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Performs in-silico digestion of a protein sequence with the chosen enzyme.
        In-silico digested peptides will be reported only they have a mass within the specified
        mass range (inclusive). Average or monoisotopic masses can be calculated for each peptide reported.
        
        <p>
        This node uses the <a href="http://javaprotlib.sourceforge.net">JavaProtLib</a> from
        the Swiss Bioinformatics Institute to perform the <i>in silico</i> digestion of the protein sequences.
        </p>
        
        <p><b>WARNING:</b> the highlighted protein sequence contains HTML markup and cannot be
        used in subsequent computations as it contains more than single-letter amino acid
        residues. The node provides a RowID column for you to join the original data to the
        results of the digestion.</p>
