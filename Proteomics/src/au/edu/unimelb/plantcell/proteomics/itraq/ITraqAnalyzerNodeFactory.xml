    <shortDescription>
        Given a (set of) proteomics runs, with identified peptides, proteins and iTRAQ quantitation values this nodes performs an analysis and provides normalised results for the user in easy-to-read format. Based on method published in the scientific literature.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Implements the method, described <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23471484">this paper</a> for analysis of iTRAQ quantitative proteomics
        data. This node requires R to be installed on the computer running KNIME and for the R extension ("Hmisc")
        to be installed with the computer. The node <b>will fail to execute</b> unless these requirements are met.
        <p>
        The node expects a raw (non-normalised) data matrix with each row representing a single peptide identification over
        all the itraq samples. Both 4-plex and 8-plex iTRAQ experiments are supported. This node requires that two channels
        are technical replicates, the other channels can be biological or technical replicates as required. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The node performs median normalisation of all channels, followed by weighted quantitation at the protein level based
        on normalised peptide results as described by the Hultin Rosenberg paper above. 
        The second output port contain plots produced by the node to help you understand the results of processing. 
        </p>
        <p>
        This node validates the input data and summarises validation to the KNIME console at the INFO level which
        can be useful when debugging a dataset. The node will abort execution if severe data problems are present in the input data.
