This plugin requires:

1) GLPK "GNU Linear Programming Kit" to compute the
minimum set cover problem used for minimum protein inferencing. GLPK v4.4 (or hopefully later works too)
must be installed on the computer where KNIME is installed for the node to operate.
Further details can be found at http://www.gnu.org/s/glpk/

2) JavaProtLib: http://javaprotlib.sourceforge.net/
From the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Excellent java proteomics library - also needs many supporting
packages as described on http://javaprotlib.sourceforge.net/packages.html

3) MascotDatFile: https://code.google.com/p/mascotdatfile/
Makes processing of Proteomics results from Mascot (www.matrixscience.com) much easier. Good support for all
results.

4) jMZML: http://code.google.com/p/jmzml/
Makes working with vendor data converted from proprietary formats much easier


The author gratefully acknowledges the authors of these packages whose excellent work
makes the nodes straightforward.
