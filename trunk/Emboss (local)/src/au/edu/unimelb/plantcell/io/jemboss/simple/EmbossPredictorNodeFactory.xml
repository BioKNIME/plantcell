    <shortDescription>
        Runs EMBOSS tools which take sequence(s) as input and provide GFF-style features for inclusion as a annotation track on the output sequences.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
         This node adds an annotation track to DNA or Protein sequence and <a 
         href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/gff/">GFF-style</a> data for the chosen sequences using the
        <a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net">EMBOSS toolkit</a>. This can be used to
        identify key regions of interest and compare them to identified peptides during a
        proteomics experiment (for example). Only EMBOSS programs which provide predictions in a GFF format are available from this node.
