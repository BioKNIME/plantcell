    <shortDescription>
        Runs augustus (http://augustus.gobics.de) on the local computer and loads its predictions into a KNIME table.

        <intro>
        Using <a href="http://augustus.gobics.de">Augustus</a> this node offers
        gene predictions (genomic and predicted protein sequences) to the user at the
        respective output ports. Augustus must be separately installed. This node <b>will not work</b>
        until you can run it successfully from the command line 
        (cygwin/cmd.exe for Windows or Terminal for Mac users). Tips
        for doing this correctly are as follows:
        <table>
        	<tr><th>Platform</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
        	<tr><td>Win32</td> <td>Compile using cygwin. Be sure that c:\cygwin\bin
        	is added to the DOS path (a reboot may be necessary).</td></tr>
        	
        	<tr><td>Mac</td><td>GCC is recommended, although perhaps a pre-built
        	executable is available from the Augustus website.</td></tr>
        </table>
        
        <p><b>Note:</b> this node is only tested with Augustus v2.5.5, other versions are untested.

        <option name="FASTA file">Which file (can not be compressed) to load sequences from. FASTA files only for now.</option>
        <option name="Predict on ... strands?">Report predictions considering both strands, by default. Or select the strand of interest.</option>
    	<option name="Gene model">Which gene model to use for prediction. The node automatically scans
    	the augustus <b>config/species</b> folder to identify those species which are available.</option>
    	<option name="Predict strands independently?">If checked (yes) then permit overlapping gene predictions
    	from opposing strands. This turns off UTR prediction unless you specify otherwise.</option>
    	<option name="Other arguments">For advanced users only, that understand augustus command-line arguments.
    	If you want to keep UTR prediction, despite independent strand prediction, add <b>--UTR=on</b>, but this
    	is only support for a gene models. Any text presented here will be passed thru to augustus.</option>
