        <intro>Displays the features supported by an MSConvertEE server, so that the user can determine which pipeline steps
        will function as far as Proteomics data processing is concerned. MSConvertEE supports most features provided by Proteowizard's msconvert,
        and has many of the same limitations since it uses it, and optionally, vendor specific DLL's too. Remember that the server
        must be installed with the appropriate vendor software to function with vendor raw data. This requires agreement to the vendor's
        software license.</intro>
