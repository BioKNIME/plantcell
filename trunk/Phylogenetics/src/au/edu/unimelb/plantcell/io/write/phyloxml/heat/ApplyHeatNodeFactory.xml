    <name>add heat to Tree</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Modifies a phylogenetic tree by application of pairwise data to the tree branches, thereby placing colours on regions with the data of interest. 
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This modifies the input tree configured to include heat: a numeric value translated via a colour gradient to colour the branches of the tree. Optionally, branch widths may be set by the number of valid pairwise datapoints for taxa below the branch in the tree.
        </intro>
        
        
        <option name="Input tree">The tree to apply heat to. Ths node always creates a new tree: the input is not modified in any way</option>

        <option name="Output file">The tree, after decoration with your data, is saved to this location. Always <a href="http://www.phyloxml.org">PhyloXML format</a></option>
