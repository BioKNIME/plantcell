   <description name="Plant Cell Biology KNIME nodes" url="http://www.plantcell.unimelb.edu.au/bioinformatics/knime">
      A set of nodes aimed at providing support for Proteomics, Phylogenetics and Cell Biology.
      
      An initial set of capabilities is now available, but things are rough and incomplete/buggy. This release
      should be considered an alpha release and users are encouraged to submit bug reports
      and make feature requests. Software patches very welcome!
      
      Currently the release includes integration of many other java-based projects: biojava,
      javaprotlib, EBI web services, jEMBOSS, GLPK and many others. Without their work, this
      release would not be possible. Please read the LICENSE and ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS files with
      this release for more information.
