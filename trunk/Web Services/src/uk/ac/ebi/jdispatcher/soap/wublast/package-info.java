/**
 * WU-BLAST stands for Washington University Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. The emphasis of this tool is to find regions of sequence similarity or homology quickly, with minimum loss of sensitivity. This will yield functional and evolutionary clues about the structure and function of your novel sequence. Dr Warren Gish at Washington University released this first "gapped" version of BLAST allowing for gapped alignments and statistics.
