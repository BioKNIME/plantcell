    <shortDescription>
        Provides a KNIME interface to the ESTScan program, estscan.sourceforge.net as an attempt
        to identify possible coding sequences for further analysis.

        <intro>
        <p>
        Provides access to <a href="http://estscan.sourceforge.net">ESTScan</a> program (version 3.0.3)
        within KNIME. This node can be used to identify coding sequences with high-specificity and sensitivity. This node submits batches of up to 100 sequences at a time, so can be used to
        scan large sequencing datasets if desired. It is <b>strongly</b> recommended to read the 
        documentation for ESTScan: in particular, the performance may be poor if an unsuitable model is used.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Note: </b> this node is only workable for University of Melbourne staff/students and collaborators as it
        uses a server only accessible from on-campus.
