    <shortDescription>
        Basic two sample Students t-test

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        Computes two sample t-test statistics for the chosen significance level over pairs of samples
        (ie. columns) for every chosen column as specified in the node configuration. Reported P-Values
        are for two-sided tests, Boolean true/false values are based on a two-sided null hypothesis.
       
       <p>
        The sample data may be paired or unpaired (the default). If paired datapoints are chosen
        only samples with equal numbers of datapoints will be compared and reported.

        <option name="Alpha (significance level)">What significance level for testing the null hypothesis (that all
        samples are from the same population). Default is 0.05, must be in the range [0,1]</option>

        in columns, select the columns here. At least two must be chosen.</option>

        not having the same number of data points will <b>not</b> be reported if this option is selected.</option>
