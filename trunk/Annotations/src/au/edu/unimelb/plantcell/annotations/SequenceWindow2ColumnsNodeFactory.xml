       Extracts computational results for a short window(s) of sequence(s) to the output port.
        You may specify how the window is to be computed and sized.

        You may specify how the window is to be computed and sized, see the <i>Window Settings</i> tab in the
        configuration for details.

       		<b>Note:</b>This node can generate lots of data (one row per window per input sequence)
        				so be careful not to generate a massive table!
