    <shortDescription>
        Extracts the user configured data from sequence cells into separate columns for
        further analysis. See the related String2Sequence node for further information.

        <intro>Extracts the user configured data from sequence cells into separate columns for
        further analysis. Specify only the sequence column to use and the attributes to be extracted, as described below:

        	<tr>
        		<th>Data to extract</th><th>Notes</th>
        	</tr>

        		<td>Sequence ID</td>
        		<td>The primary sequence ID</td>
        	</tr>
        	
        	<tr>
        		<td>Annotated Sequence</td>
        		<td>The sequence with all tracks and annotation</td>
        	</tr>
        	
        	<tr>
        		<td>Description (primary)</td>
        		<td>The primary textual description associated with the sequence eg. predicted protein</td>
        	</tr>
        	
        	<tr>
        		<td>Sequence (single-letter)</td>
        		<td>A string column with single-letter residues</td>
        	</tr>
        	
        	<tr>
        		<td>Track ...</td>
        		<td>Extract a track's data into separate columns, one row per feature. Extracting multiple
        		tracks using one node is not recommended, as this causes a large, sparse, table. Better to use
        		multiple nodes (one per track).</td>
