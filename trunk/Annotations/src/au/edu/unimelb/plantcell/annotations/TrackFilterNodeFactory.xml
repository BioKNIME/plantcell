    <name>Track Filter</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
       Filters data between two tracks using boolean logic (AND/OR/XOR) 
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Filters data between two tracks using boolean logic. Where a bioinformatics
        tool has predicted a region of interest, this may be used to select measurements relating to the region.
        
        Currently, the following comparisons may be done between tracks:
        <table>
        	<tr><th>Operation</th><th>Description</th></tr>
        	<tr><td>A overlaps B</td><td>Where region from track A is at least partly the same as a region from track B</td></tr>
        	<tr><td>A not overlaps B</td><td>Where a region from track A does not many any region from track B</td></tr>
        	<tr><td>A completely within B</td><td>If a region from track A is completely spanned by any region from B</td></tr>
        	<tr><td>B completely within A</td><td>Same as previous, but in reverse.</td></tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>
        <b>Note: </b>the implementation is currently naive and slow: algorithmic complexity
        is <tt>O(n^2)</tt> with respect to the number of regions being compared. The node
        automatically filters sequences from the output with no hits and removes empty
        tracks from any filtered sequence. Only hits for the chosen filter criteria are reported to the output.

        <option name="Column to process">Select the column of sequences with at least two annotated tracks
        (with regions) for comparison. For example, sequences annotated with TMHMM (transmembrane helix prediction)and 
        StringFinder nodes (eg. identified peptides)can be used here. Tracks can come from many other nodes too
        (eg. BLAST or InterPro)</option>
