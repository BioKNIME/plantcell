    <name>SEG low complexity filter (local)</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Supports running a local seg executable and integration into the KNIME-PlantCell platform
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Supports running a local SEG executable, which is available from the <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/seg/seg/">NCBI's FTP site</a>. SEG
        performs masking and highlighting of low-complexity regions in protein/nucleotide sequence. You must select
        the downloaded/installed program to run and the sequences to filter. Options controlling seg behaviour can also
        be set.

        <option name="SEG Executable">
        Choose the folder which contains the install MAFFT program you would like to use. Only Windows systems are supported at the moment.</option>
        <option name="Sequences Column">List or set of sequence cells to perform alignment on. A separate alignment is performed for each row.</option>
        <option name="User defined options">(Advanced users only)</option>
        <option name="Report log messages to KNIME console">Report log/debug messages to the KNIME console? Default is off as it can lead to large amount of output and slow performance.</option>
