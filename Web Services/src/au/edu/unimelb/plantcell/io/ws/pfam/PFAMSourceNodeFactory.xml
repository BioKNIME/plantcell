        <intro>
        Provides an interface to Sanger Institute PFAM RESTful webservice.
        
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> the node is deliberately slow (which is not user-configurable) to ensure that Sanger's websites
        are not overloaded, and that a KNIME user is not banned.</p>
        
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> This node does not provide all the functionality of the website, but it does provide enough, if carefully used,
        to be able to fetch the data. It is <b>strongly</b> recommended that you test with just a few rows and verify results with the website itself
        before processing large datasets.</p>
