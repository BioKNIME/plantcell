    <shortDescription>
        Provides a KNIME interface to phosphorylation site prediction via a local server to the University
        of Melbourne

        <intro>
        <p>
        This node is similar to the NetPhos Accessor in the webservices category, but uses a local server 
        in the Nectar Research cloud to provide much improved throughput compared to the 
        <a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ws/ws.php?entry=NetPhos">CBS server in Denmark</a>. 
        This server provides access to v3.1b of NetPhos.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Note: </b> this node is only workable for University of Melbourne staff/students and collaborators as it
        uses a server only accessible from on-campus.
