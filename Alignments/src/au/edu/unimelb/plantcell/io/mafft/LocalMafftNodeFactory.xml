        <intro>Supports running a local mafft executable and integration into the KNIME-PlantCell platform. This is a very fast multiple sequence
        aligner for both protein and nucleotide sequences. The node provides only the automatic algorithm selection at the moment. MAFFT
        is available for download from the <a href="http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/">CBRC website in Japan</a>

        <option name="MAFFT Root Folder">
        Choose the folder which contains the install MAFFT program you would like to use. Only Windows systems are supported at the moment.</option>
        <option name="Sequences to align">Column of sequences to perform alignment on. If the chosen column is a collection cell (list or set)
        a separate alignment is performed for each row, otherwise all sequences (from the chosen column) are aligned as one.</option>
        <option name="Algorithm">Only automatic is supported at the moment</option>
        <option name="Report log messages to KNIME console">Report log/debug messages to the KNIME console? Default is off as it can lead to large amount of output and slow performance.</option>
