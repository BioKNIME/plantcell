/**
 * T-Coffee is a multiple sequence alignment program. The main characteristic of T-Coffee is that it will allow you to combine results obtained with several alignment methods. By default, T-Coffee will compare all you sequences two by two, producing a global alignment and a series of local alignments (using lalign). The program will then combine all these alignments into a multiple alignment.
